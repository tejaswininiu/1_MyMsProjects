# Master's in Management Information Systems.
Pursuing Masters in Management Information Systems gave me good deep insight on importance of Information systems for an Organization.
Information Systems can be of any type. But it needs to be backed by a good BackEnd Database.
A Good BackEnd Database needs a good design. This is what I learned when I attended my Databases Management Systems class in Masters.
Though SQL is not new to me by then. I have already learnt it and had used it for about 3 years.
I got chance to brush it up again.

" Data is big asset for an organization " is what I learned when I started learning few advance level courses like Social Media Analytics,
Big Data Analytics, Advanced statistics for Business Analytics.
Fruits of Maintaining a costly Information System and all it's data can be tasted only when a thorough Analysis is done on the data.
My journey through various courses in Masters has taught me this enough along with various tools and technologies needed to be a good
Data Analyst/ Data Scientist.

I worked on couple of projects to put the learning from these courses into practice.
This Repository presents of Samples of these projects.
Technologies used in these Academic Projects are :SQL, Python, SAS studio, PowerBI, R.
